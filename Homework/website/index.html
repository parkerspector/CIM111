      <h1 id="mainTitle">About Me</h1>
      <p>Currently, I am a sophomore at the University of Miami majoring in creative advertising and double minoring in marketing and interactive media. One of my favorite hobbies is to travel with my family. Most recently, we went to Scotland, Spain and Colombia. Traveling with my family makes going to all these places so much better because I get to enjoy it with the people I love.</p>

              <h3>Scotland</h3>
            <p> In Edinburgh, my favorite memory was going to Arthur's seat. We went to Aruthur's seat the day after it snowed and snow only means one thing...snowballs. So of course my older brother just had to create a snowball to throw at our older sister, the only problem was she was a moving target and his aim wasn't the best. He ended up pegging a stranger that was behind my sister and we all cracked up along with the random guy we just hit.</p>

          <h3>Spain</h3>
        <p> In Madrid, my favorite memory was seeing the 80 sculptures of Las Meninas around the city. Everytime my mom would see a Las Menias, she would take a picture, even if it meant having to cross the street to get it. Her goal was to see how many she could get a picture of, in the hopes to find almost all 80. It was just nice to see my mom get all happy over something as little as a statue.</p>

        <h3>Colombia</h3>
      <p> In Cartegena, my favorite memory was going out on christmas eve with my siblings. Both my siblings are older, so when we do get the chance to go out together, I feel closer to them. When we went out that night, we also ran into multiple families from our town in New York and we made it a night to remember.</p>

      <h3>Overall</h3>
    <p> In the end, all of these trips were amazing because I got to spend time with my family and explore the world. We love traveling, we even booked our trip for December break where we will be going to Amsterdam and France to ski.</p>
