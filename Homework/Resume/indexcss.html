  <h2> About Parker</h2>
    <p>Being in a club is a way to experience a little bit of everything before stepping out into the real world. I learned how to work with others in a team, business, and work environment. I’m always thinking out of the box; asking the questions that everyone else is afraid to and answering the ones people are curious about. One way I learned to think out of the box this year was in DECA. There was a competition online, “The DECA Idea Challenge”, where you are told the challenge and have one week to solve it. This year the task was to make something mainly out of cardboard. My friends and I decided to team up and join. At first, we were all shouting out ideas until I thought of the clothing drive I went on with the school. One thing that really stood out to me was how quickly shoes were getting taken at each stop. Finally, I suggested making cardboard shoes that we could send to poor countries or give to underprivileged families called “Cardboard Walks”. The only problem is that cardboard will get ruined if it gets wet, so we put our heads together and thought if we were to melt bee’s wax onto the shoe then the shoe will become waterproof. It actually worked! We made the shoe, shot the video, and sent it in to the competition. My friends and I ended up winning the challenge for the whole United States and from that moment on I knew I was able to accomplish anything I put my mind to. I am now, an international finalist in the DECA Idea Challenge.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am a sophomore at the University of Miami majoring in creative advertising and double minoring in marketing and interactive media. I am looking to explore careers that will help me grow professionally and intellectually. As a hard working, determined individual, I will work not only to meet expectations, but to exceed them.</p>
